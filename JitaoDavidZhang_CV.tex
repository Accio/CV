\section{Founding, leading, and serving teams}

\cvitem{2024--\hspace{4.25ex}}{Currently I assume the role of Portfolio Lead for cardiovascular metabolism, immunology, infectious disease, ophthalmology of the Predictive Modeling and Data Analytics team. I coordinate project support and innovation activities with input from more than 60 experts with a wide range of expertise in computational biology, biostatistics, translational modeling and simulation, disease modeling, and pharmacometrics. I work closely with other Portfolio Leads to present the team in communities and decision boards. Our teamwork has made critical impact on dozens of portfolio projects ranging from entry into portfolio to clinical trials and filing.}
\cvitem{2024--2025}{I served as a core team member of the PADCo (PBPK-ADME-DPL) community, organizing and facilitating meetings, exchanges, and activities of the community, which consists of more than 100 experts in modelling and simulation, drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, translational drug metabolism-pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics, and clinical pharmacology.}
\cvitem{2022--2024}{I co-founded and lead a new research group within my organization, with 6 permanent positions, 2 postdocs, and interns. The team consists of computational scientists with training or working experience in toxicology, chemistry, biology, and statistics. I led the interviews and the on-boarding of new employees. I am responsible for integrating the team in the working environment, embedding the team in the process of drug discovery and development, and defining the team's vision, strategy, and scientific focus. The team has grown to become an indispensable unit in our organization.}
\cvitem{2022--2023}{I led a cross-functional team of about 30 people to improve the productivity and efficiency with regard to data, insight, and knowledge management. Stakeholders and team members gave positive feedback to the organization and the product of the team. The outcome has led to changes in how data and computational models are captured and used.}
